# Love Calculator Project

Welcome to the Love Calculator project! This is an exciting JavaScript-based web application where I'm showcasing my skills in HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Bootstrap, and Canva. The project is a fun and interactive tool that calculates "love compatibility" between two names, adding a playful twist to web development.

## Project Description

The Love Calculator is a personal project that demonstrates:
- **HTML & CSS:** Structuring and styling the webpage for an intuitive user experience.
- **JavaScript:** Adding interactivity and functionality to the calculator.
- **Bootstrap:** Utilizing responsive design to ensure compatibility across devices.
- **Canva:** Designing engaging visual elements to enhance the user interface.

You can view the design for this project [here on Canva](https://lehotel1.my.canva.site/the-love-calculator).

## Features
- A clean, visually appealing interface.
- Input fields for entering two names.
- A "Calculate" button that triggers a JavaScript function to compute a random "compatibility score."
- Responsive design for seamless use on desktop and mobile devices.

## Purpose
This project is my way of practicing and applying web development concepts independently while having fun creating something lighthearted. It's also an opportunity to showcase my ability to combine creativity with technical skills.
